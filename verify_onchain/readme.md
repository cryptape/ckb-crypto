# Verify on chain
## Summary
We provide `ed25519, sm2(sm3), r1, rsa2048` verification algorithms. The `/botan_riscv` directory is the riscv compileable code of the botan password library. We have modified it to make the static library under the riscv tool chain. It is not recommended to use the `./configure.py` script to re-extract the source code to generate a `Makefile`, and make it directly in the directory to generate a static library.
## Usage
For different algorithms, we provide different script files to generate the elf file of the corresponding riscv architecture, which can be generated by running it directly. The directory is the corresponding algorithm directory.
For example, we want to generate sm2 verification program
```$xslt
$ ./make_sm2.sh
$ cd sm2
```
And you can find the target file in this directory.
## How to use it on chain
Similarly, we give the verification unlock script file, the directory is in `/tx-verify`. 
And we provide detailed on-chain operation in the directory. 

## TODO
**There is a problem that has not been resolved. In the include path, we use the on-chain operation files provided by ckb. But when we upload the parameters in the chain, it can't be compiled in C++ environment. However, the definition of cplusplus is provided in the header file, and I don't know how to solve it here. Therefore, we temporarily wrote the algorithm signature and public key in the .cpp file to facilitate accurate verification of the signature.**
